# Universal Shrimp verification

Run from the repository root with Node.js (no dependencies):

```sh
node tests/shrimp-balance.cjs
REQUIRE_TEN_YEAR=1 REVIEW_SEED=7 node tests/shrimp-playthrough.cjs
REQUIRE_TEN_YEAR=1 REVIEW_SEED=19 node tests/shrimp-playthrough.cjs
REQUIRE_TEN_YEAR=1 REVIEW_SEED=42 node tests/shrimp-playthrough.cjs
```

The balance suite checks milestone boundaries, JSON save migration, historical
unlock suppression, legacy victory, owner-operated packing, payroll guards,
working-capital reserves, farm recovery, breeder protection, permanent lab
quality, sandbox opt-in, campaign and film recaps, operating accounting, shrimp-to-kit conservation, industrial packing capacity,
warehouse limits, staged marketing/shops, speed gates accrued annual-tax reserves, the opening story, letter persistence, ten-year
boundaries, non-punitive continuation and old-story migration.

The seeded playthrough uses the actual simulation and purchase functions. It
acknowledges milestone pauses, respects UI reveal gates, feeds/changes water,
assembles kits and invests in breeding, packing tiers, regions and projects.
It uses the same World/project and preceding-tier gates as the interface, and
fails immediately on insolvency. It must reach the
worldwide ending within 12,000 game days. It is a deterministic strategy replay,
not a human pacing or optimal-strategy claim. JSON results are written under
`/private/tmp/shrimp-tests`, or `REVIEW_OUTPUT` if supplied.

Browser QA covers fresh start, restored cycle milestone, next-step navigation,
Kits/Operations/Marketing/World, contextual projects, purchase forecasts,
advertising, mothball/restart, legacy packing migration, lab scope, global
victory and sandbox, including a 390×844 phone viewport and desktop. Preview
saves stay outside the published repository.

`REVIEW_KIT_PRICE=market` follows the suggested kit-price button; a numeric value
uses that kit price after the first farm. `REQUIRE_TEN_YEAR=1` also requires the
special achievement; ordinary runs may finish after the celebration.

For the late-finish path, run `REQUIRE_AFTER_TEN_YEAR=1 REVIEW_KIT_PRICE=400
node tests/shrimp-playthrough.cjs` on one line. This requires a completed game
after the ten-year celebration, with no timely achievement awarded.

Academic progression and parallel space chapter:

```sh
node tests/shrimp-academy.cjs
REVIEW_ACADEMY=1 REVIEW_KIT_PRICE=250 REVIEW_OUTPUT=/private/tmp/shrimp-academy-play node tests/shrimp-playthrough.cjs
ACADEMY_RUN=/private/tmp/shrimp-academy-play/run-7.json node tests/shrimp-space-playthrough.cjs
```

The academic suite checks prepaid budgets, idle/unfunded pauses, saved partial
work, effects applied to actual packing and machine purchases, funded career
requirements, teaching, old-save migration, independent year-ten access, Earth
archival after victory, and both heat-management routes. The space continuation
uses the anniversary state produced by the full Earth replay, buys missions and
habitat systems through simulation actions, completes new research and all four
worlds, checks every completed habitat is sustainable at full capacity, and
asserts Earth adoption grew during the space journey.

The average-player replay uses the default kit price and buys one inexpensive
starter colony. It checks weekly while cycling and monthly after opening the
business, limits each visit to two investments, keeps the listed prices, and
does not calculate a perfect investment order. It completes the Earth and
space chapters without insolvency within 20 game years. This is a reproducible
conservative scenario, not observed human play data:

```sh
REVIEW_OUTPUT=/private/tmp/shrimp-average-monthly node tests/shrimp-average-playthrough.cjs
```

On seed 7, Earth completes in 18.6 game years and space in 17.6, with a lowest
cash balance of AED 120. The browser check also followed the opening tank
cycle, three water changes to meet the displayed targets, the first shrimp
purchase, heat management and first hatch milestone.

Observed seed 7 with the academy strategy and AED 400 kit price: pilot grant day
1417, PhDs day 1782, six Earth discoveries day 1800, professor day 2145. Space
started day 3650 with Earth unfinished and completed day 4211, while Earth
adoption increased from 1.94 billion to 3.05 billion. This is one strategy replay;
research remains optional for the Earth ending. The original no-research seed
7/19/42 replays still finish on days 3448/3497/3359.

## Pacing after the October 21 pass (Claude)

Seeds 7/19/42 with the default strategy (kit price 600) win on days ~2,570-2,595
(about 7 years). A simpler greedy bot spans 8 to 18 years depending only on kit
price: 600 → 8.2 y, adaptive up to 400 → 10.5 y, 300 → 13.7 y, the 280 default
untouched → 15 y, 250 → 18 y. The Market price button never goes below cost +20%. The academy + space fixture
needs an Earth still unfinished at year ten, so it uses `REVIEW_KIT_PRICE=250`
(Earth wins day ~4,108; space runs day 3,650 → ~4,600).

Changed numbers: kit awareness 0.6, starting referral rate 1.2%/day, early
word-of-mouth projects +0.6%, farm license AED 1,000, grow rack AED 1,200, farms
+9% per copy (was 12%), mega hatchery AED 20M, ocean permit AED 100M, arcology
blueprint AED 3B. Space costs ×10, colony growth 0.4%/day (0.6% with genes),
60 stable days to settle, crew needs 200/600/1,200/2,500, courses train 1 crew/day,
contracts give 50 crew for AED 10M.

## Working together (Codex + Claude)

Both agents edit the same file: `site/shrimp/index.html` in this repository.
No Desktop copies. Before editing, check `git status`/`git diff` for the other
agent's uncommitted work and build on it; run the four test commands above after
any balance change. Claude does not commit or push; Codex commits.

Flow pass (21 Oct, Claude): pet shop orders appear during breeding (accept, then
deliver qualifying non-breeder shrimp for a 1.5-2.5x price); each business tab
shows at most 3 projects; at 40x the game drops to 12x when something new opens
(toggle in Game settings); 40x needs the old profit test *and* a million owners
(`fastReady` then `fastUnlocked`). Bot pacing at max allowed speed: strong 7.8 min,
casual 11.3 min of waiting (was 6.4 / 8.3); busiest 30 s holds 28 new things (was 46).

Shrimp-free ripple (21 Oct, Claude): owners slowly stop eating shrimp
(`rippleDay`, rate 0.0008 × kit survival, faster with "friends not food",
World Shrimp Day and the retraining fund). 25 headlines (`RIPPLE`) fire at
10k ... 2.75B shrimp-free people, shown in World → The Shrimp Times. Effects:
trawler headline cools Fire −8% (undone by the AED 500k retraining fund),
mangroves give ✦, wild shrimp cut farm upkeep 5%, typhoon makes regions 10%
cheaper, blue carbon pays AED per shrimp-free person per day. Strong bot sees
all 25 by its win (~day 2,990); the casual bot by ~day 4,900.
